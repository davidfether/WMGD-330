## Some things to keep in mind

• Test on either actual devices or the iOS simulator.

• This project is as much about developing the project as it is about time management. Develop a plan early and do your best to stick to that plan.

• When something isn’t working, don’t just sit there. Get up and do something else. Go outside, play with your pet, or watch a movie. Come back to the project later and there is a good chance whatever was tripping you up before will be obvious for you to fix.

• Ask questions!
