  <h1>Flexbox</h1>
  <div>
    <p>
      The Flexbox Layout (Flexible Box) module (a W3C Candidate Recommendation
      as of October 2017) aims at providing a more efficient way to lay out,
      align and distribute space among items in a container, even when their
      size is unknown and/or dynamic (thus the word “flex”).
