                    <p>Media queries is a CSS3 module allowing content rendering to adapt to conditions such as screen resolution (e.g. smartphone screen vs. computer screen). It became a W3C recommended standard in June 2012, and is a cornerstone technology of responsive web design</p>

                    <p class="blue-call-out">Media Queries should be organic, and based on the design of the website, or a specific device.</p>
